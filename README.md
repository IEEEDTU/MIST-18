Run a local web server for development
If you're building a web app, some parts of the Firebase JavaScript SDK require that your web app be served from a server rather than from the local filesystem. You can use the Firebase CLI to run a local server like this:

$ npm install -g firebase-tools\
$ firebase init    
 Generate a firebase.json (REQUIRED)\
$ firebase serve  
 Start development server
